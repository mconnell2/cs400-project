Outstanding Issues<br>
Add food Item working (Michelle to fix)<br>
-needs to refresh food list<br>
-if I add food item manually, then load list, should list contain both? I think that's OK.<br>
Filter needs to filter and indicate list is filtered(Mark)<br>
Save button not working (Julie/David) <br>
Help icon pop up needs to be added (David)<Br>
